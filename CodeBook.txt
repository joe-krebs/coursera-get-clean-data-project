File: merged_dataset.csv
=================

This dataset is the merge of the UCI HAR training and testing datasets

Subjects        
=================
The subjects for this study are identified by a unique ID number.

Activities
================
The 6 activities on which measurements were taken are the following:
    walking
    walking_upstairs
    walking_downstairs
    sitting
    standing
    laying

Features 
=================
The features selected for this database are the mean and standard deviation mesurements from the UCI HAR Dataset. The following signals are characterized:

tbodyacc.xyz
tgravityacc.xyz
tbodyaccjerk.xyz
tbodygyro.xyz
tbodygyrojerk.xyz
tbodyaccmag
tgravityaccmag
tbodyaccjerkmag
tbodygyromag
tbodygyrojerkmag
fbodyacc.xyz
fbodyaccjerk.xyz
fbodygyro.xyz
fbodyaccmag
fbodyaccjerkmag
fbodygyromag
fbodygyrojerkmag

Variables
=================
The set of variables that were estimated for subject/activity/signal combinations are: 

mean: Mean value
std: Standard deviation

Where dimensional coordinates are required, mean and std estimates are further elaborated with "-x", "-y", or "-z" to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
